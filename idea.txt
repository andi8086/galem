Input pins are connected to the columns of the fabric.
One column is for the non-inverted and one for the inverted input signal.
The column can be connected to every row of the AND fabric.

The jedec file lists rows of the fabric which represent an input line
to the OLMC OR gate or have special other functions.

Since the bitmap acts on the rows and defines connections to
source columns, the column is the source of the signals to compute.
Each column can only have one input. Columns are organised in quadruples.
One for input, one for inverted input, one for feedback from OLMC output
and one for inverted feedback from OLMC output.

When calculating an input to the OR Gate, the corresponding lines have
to be sampled. This means an AND array must be calculated with all activated columns as input. On the GAL16V8, each AND has 32 inputs.

Inputs to the chip should be held in a struct where pointers are taken and
appended to the and gate. This way, the and gate references the inputs directly.
